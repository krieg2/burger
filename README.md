# Eat-A-Burger

This node single page application allows users to create burgers and devour them. A mySQL database stores all burgers and their state (uneaten, or devoured). Enter the description of a new burger and click submit to create a new one. Click on the "Devour It" button to eat a burger and it will move to the left column on the page.
